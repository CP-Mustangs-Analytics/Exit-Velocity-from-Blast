# Exit-Velocity-from-Blast
calculating exit velocity from blast metrics

The metrics used were swing speed and on plane efficiency

The exit velocities were calculated using an equation derived by Alan Nathan in his paper "Characterizing the performance of baseball bats" which can be found here: http://baseball.physics.illinois.edu/AJP-Feb2003.pdf
    The equation: exit velocity = ea(velocity of the ball) + (1 + ea)(velocity of the bat) 
ea is the collision efficiency which is related to the ball exit speed ratio (BESR). BESR was used to quantify bat performance before BBCOR was used 

R packages used:
  ggplot2
